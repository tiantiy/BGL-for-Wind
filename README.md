# Beta-Generalized Lindley (BGL) Distribution: A Novel Probability Model for Wind Speed

## Introduction
In this work, we introduce a novel four-parameter distribution for wind speed, which outperforms other reference distributions and is known as the beta-generalized
Lindley (BGL) distribution. 

## Data
The preprocessed wind speed data is provided on this GitHub page. The first two columns are time. The third column is the wind speed at 2 meters in height, the fourth for 5 meters, the fifth for 10 meters, the sixth for 20 meters, the seventh for 50 meters, and the last for 80 meters.
