# Beta-Generalized Lindley (BGL) Distribution: A Novel Probability Model for Wind Speed
The preprocessed wind speed data is provided on this GitHub page. The first two columns are time. The third column is wind speed at 2 meters height, and the fourth for 5 meters, the fifth for 10 meters, the sixth for 20 meters, the seventh for 50 meters, and the last for 80 meters. 

The original wind speed data can be downloaded at
